Introduction
==============================

This project is a 3D rendering engine written in Python, utilizing OpenCV for image rendering and NumPy for mathematical computations. The engine simulates a 3D environment, applying transformations, lighting, and rendering objects to a 2D plane.

The main components include:
- **Engine**: The core engine that manages the rendering process.
- **CameraModel**: Handles the camera's perspective and rendering.
- **Matrix_Functions**: Provides functions for creating transformation matrices.
- **Clipping_Space**: Manages perspective projection and clipping.
- **FpsCounter**: Tracks and displays the frames per second (FPS).
